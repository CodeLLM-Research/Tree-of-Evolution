You are highly skilled at crafting high-quality [Programming Questions] for Code Generation. Your task is to create a new [Programming Question] inspired by the provided [Old Question]. Follow the steps below:

Step 1: Review the Provided [Old Question]:
```
{{ example }}
```

An expert has evaluated the **challenge level** of the [Old Question] based on the following criteria:
1. Complexity: Does the question require advanced concepts or multiple steps?
2. Conceptual Depth: Does it challenge fundamental concept application in new ways?
3. Skill Level: Is the difficulty suitable for the audience, pushing their abilities?
4. Edge Cases & Optimization: Does it require handling edge cases or optimizing beyond brute force?
**The challenge level of the [Old Question] is rated as {{ comp_s }} (on a scale of 1 to 10).**

Another expert has evaluated the **diversity** of the [Old Question] based on the following criterion:
1. Diversity: Does the question present less common coding tasks or offer unique problem-solving scenarios?
(1 = minimal diverse, 10 = exceptionally diverse).
**The diversity level of the [Old Question] is rated as {{ div_s }} (on a scale of 1 to 10).**

Analyze the [Old Question] and develop a detailed [Plan] for creating a new [Programming Question] that surpasses the [Old Question] in both **challenge level** and **diversity level**.

Step 2: Follow the [Plan] to create the [Programming Question]. The new question should offer:
- A higher level of challenge based on the evaluation criteria.
- Greater diversity by incorporating unique or less common coding tasks.
Your final goal is to craft a [Programming Question] that is more challenging and diverse than the provided [Old Question].
Only provide the [Programming Question] in this step. **DO NOT** compare with the [Old Question] and **DO NOT** discuss how complex and diverse of the question.

Please respond strictly in the following format:
